<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" style="height:20vh; width:20vh" class="profile-pic" /> | Hey there, I am Fahim Karim. I started this blog to introduce people to Swarm Intelligence and tell them about my experience implementing some of the algorithms under this discipline. The main intentions behind this blog is to introduce people to this field and make them understand some of the popular algorithms which will hopefully encourage them to pursue further knowledge outside the scope of this blog. With the recent advancements in Edge Computing, the future of SI-based techniques looks promising and I hope this blog is able to play a small role in getting people interested in Swarm Intelligence.
