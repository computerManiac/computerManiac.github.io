<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" style="height:20vh; width:20vh" class="profile-pic" /> | Hey there, I am Fahim Karim. I started this blog to introduce people to Swarm Intelligence and tell them about my experience implementing some of the algorithms under this discipline. The main intentions behind this blog is to introduce people to this field and make them understand some of the popular algorithms which will hopefully encourage them to pursue further knowledge outside the scope of this blog. With the recent advancements in Edge Computing, the future of SI-based techniques looks promising and I hope this blog is able to play a small role in getting people interested in Swarm Intelligence.

I am a Software Developer at Bank of New York Mellon. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering in 2020. I have interests in Machine Learning, Big Data Engineering, Swarm Intelligence, Evolutionary Algorithms, Single- & Multi-objective Optimization techniques. I have particular research interest in Swarm Intelligence and working on SI-based approaches to improve Machine Learning techniques. Before joining Bank of New York Mellon, I had been a research assistant at IISc Bangalore and a python teaching assistant at Internshala.
