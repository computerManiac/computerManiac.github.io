  summary: 'In this post we discuss the key concept behind Swarm Intelligence and learn how nature inspired Computer Scientists and programmers 
            to develop artificial systems that mimic social creatures. We build a basic intuition about some concepts that are common in all algorithms 
            that come under this discipline.'

  summary: 'In this post we introduce our first Swarm Intelligence algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). First we learn how ACO is modelled
            then we dive deeper and understand how it works. We look at the pseudocode and understand how to implement ACO in any language. Finally we
            discuss the advantages and shortcomings of ACO.'

  summary: 'In this post we introduce our second Swarm Intelligence algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First we learn how PSO is modelled
            then we dive deeper and understand how it works. We look at the pseudocode and understand how to implement PSO in any language. Finally we
            discuss various applications of PSO.'
