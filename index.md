## Welcome

This is a blog series where we discuss various algorithms that fall under the Swarm Intelligence paradigm and its applications in
various fields including Machine Learning, function optimizations etc.

### What is Swarm Intelligence ?

Swarm Intelligence is a discipline under Computer Science that deals with natural and artificial systems which are composed of many inviduals
that coordinate together to achieve complex tasks using <span style="color:3498eb;font-weight:bold">self-organization</span> and <span style="color:3498eb;font-weight:bold">division of labour</span>. Most algorithms that come under this discipline were inspired by the social behaviour of animals and other organisms, particularly by the behaviour of social insects like ants, bees etc.
