<p>This is a blog series where we discuss various algorithms that fall under the Swarm Intelligence paradigm and its applications in
various fields including Machine Learning, function optimizations etc.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-swarm-intelligence-">What is Swarm Intelligence ?</h3>

<p>Swarm Intelligence is a discipline under Computer Science that deals with natural and artificial systems which are composed of many inviduals
that coordinate together to achieve complex tasks using <span class="bold-text">self-organization</span> and <span class="bold-text">division of labour</span>. Most algorithms that come under this discipline were inspired by the social behaviour of animals and other organisms, particularly by the behaviour of social insects like ants, bees etc. This blog series discusses some of 
the popular algorithms and how they are used to solve various problems.</p>

                In this post we discuss the key concept behind Swarm Intelligence and learn how nature inspired Computer Scientists
                and programmers to develop artificial systems that mimic social creatures. We build a basic intuition about some concepts
                that are common in all algorithms that come under this discipline.
